# Final_project
Dense smoke and haze obscures crucial details in critical scenarios, hindering exact object identification and overall situational awareness. This project tackles this challenge by 
proposing a novel, real-time vision enhancement system with integrated human detection capabilities.
 
 
Our approach perfects the Dark Channel Prior algorithm, employing filtering, sampling, and a guided filter to achieve rapid and correct haze removal while preserving vital image details. 
We have also used the estimation of global atmospheric light which further helps in significantly improved image clarity. Additionally, histogram equalization further enhances 
image contrast for best visibility.

This integrated system empowers users with a clear, real-time view, enabling precise object identification, particularly humans. This translates to faster decision-making and improved 
performance in critical situations. The system's focus on human detection and overall vision clarity contributes to enhanced accuracy and efficiency in various applications.
